ham	The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
ham	drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
spam	proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
spam	his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
ham	a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
ham	his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
ham	lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
ham	so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
spam	stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
ham	more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the
spam	matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
spam	him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
spam	jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
ham	no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
ham	gravity.
spam	At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
ham	proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
ham	made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
spam	assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
spam	hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
ham	invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
ham	to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
spam	this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
spam	disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
spam	"And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch," said Mr.
spam	Stryver.
ham	The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
spam	again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
spam	"You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
spam	to-day. Every question told."
spam	"I always am sound; am I not?"
spam	"I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
ham	it and smooth it again."
ham	With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
spam	"The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School," said Stryver, nodding
spam	his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, "the
ham	old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
ham	now in despondency!"
ham	"Ah!" returned the other, sighing: "yes! The same Sydney, with the same
ham	luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own."
ham	"And why not?"
spam	"God knows. It was my way, I suppose."
spam	He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
ham	him, looking at the fire.
ham	"Carton," said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
spam	as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
spam	was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
ham	Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, "your way
spam	is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
spam	at me."
spam	"Oh, botheration!" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
spam	good-humoured laugh, "don't _you_ be moral!"
ham	"How have I done what I have done?" said Stryver; "how do I do what I
ham	do?"
spam	"Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth
ham	your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
spam	do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."
spam	"I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"
ham	"I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were," said
ham	Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
ham	"Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,"
spam	pursued Carton, "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
ham	mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
ham	picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
ham	didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
ham	nowhere."
spam	"And whose fault was that?"
spam	"Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
spam	driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
ham	that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy
ham	thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.
ham	Turn me in some other direction before I go."
ham	"Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness," said Stryver, holding up
spam	his glass. "Are you turned in a pleasant direction?"
ham	Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
spam	"Pretty witness," he muttered, looking down into his glass. "I have had
spam	enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?"
spam	"The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."
ham	"_She_ pretty?"
ham	"Is she not?"
spam	"No."
spam	"Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"
spam	"Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
spam	of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!"
spam	"Do you know, Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
ham	and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: "do you know, I rather
spam	thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
spam	and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"
ham	"Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
spam	yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
ham	I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink;
ham	I'll get to bed."
spam	When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
ham	him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
ham	windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
ham	dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
ham	lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
spam	before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
ham	the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
spam	Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
spam	on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
spam	wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
ham	perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
ham	from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
ham	fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
spam	A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
spam	houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
ham	pillow was wet with wasted tears.
spam	Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
spam	good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
spam	incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
spam	on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
spam	VI. Hundreds of People
ham	The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
ham	far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
ham	waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
ham	it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
ham	Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
ham	on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
spam	business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the
ham	quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
ham	On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
spam	the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
ham	Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
ham	secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
ham	them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
ham	generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
spam	his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
ham	Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
ham	them.
ham	A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
ham	found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
spam	the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
spam	had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
spam	north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
spam	grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
spam	consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
ham	instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
ham	settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
ham	the peaches ripened in their season.
ham	The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
spam	of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
spam	though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
ham	glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
spam	place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
spam	There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
ham	there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
ham	several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
spam	audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
ham	a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
ham	rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
spam	to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
ham	who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
spam	he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
spam	visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
spam	to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
ham	a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
spam	workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
spam	about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
spam	thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
spam	required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
spam	the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
spam	from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
ham	Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
ham	its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
ham	His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ham	ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
spam	he earned as much as he wanted.
ham	These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and
ham	notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
ham	on the fine Sunday afternoon.
spam	"Doctor Manette at home?"
spam	Expected home.
spam	"Miss Lucie at home?"
spam	Expected home.
spam	"Miss Pross at home?"
spam	Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
ham	anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
ham	fact.
spam	"As I am at home myself," said Mr. Lorry, "I'll go upstairs."
spam	Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her
spam	birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
spam	make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
spam	agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
ham	by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
ham	that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
spam	rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
spam	the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
spam	delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
ham	themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
spam	stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
spam	with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
ham	time, whether he approved?
ham	There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
spam	communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
spam	all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
spam	he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was
spam	the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books,
ham	and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
ham	the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
ham	changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
ham	Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's
ham	bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
spam	dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
ham	"I wonder," said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, "that he keeps
spam	that reminder of his sufferings about him!"
ham	"And why wonder at that?" was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.
ham	It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
spam	acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
ham	had since improved.
spam	"I should have thought--" Mr. Lorry began.
spam	"Pooh! You'd have thought!" said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.
ham	"How do you do?" inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
spam	express that she bore him no malice.
spam	"I am pretty well, I thank you," answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; "how
ham	are you?"
spam	"Nothing to boast of," said Miss Pross.
spam	"Indeed?"
spam	"Ah! indeed!" said Miss Pross. "I am very much put out about my
ham	Ladybird."
spam	"Indeed?"
spam	"For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll
spam	fidget me to death," said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
ham	stature) was shortness.
spam	"Really, then?" said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
ham	"Really, is bad enough," returned Miss Pross, "but better. Yes, I am
spam	very much put out."
ham	"May I ask the cause?"
ham	"I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
spam	come here looking after her," said Miss Pross.
spam	"_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?"
ham	"Hundreds," said Miss Pross.
spam	It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
ham	time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
spam	she exaggerated it.
ham	"Dear me!" said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.
ham	"I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
spam	paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
ham	your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
ham	for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it's really very hard,"
ham	said Miss Pross.
ham	Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
spam	using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
spam	fit anything.
ham	"All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
ham	are always turning up," said Miss Pross. "When you began it--"
ham	"_I_ began it, Miss Pross?"
spam	"Didn't you? Who brought her father to life?"
ham	"Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--" said Mr. Lorry.
ham	"It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
ham	enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
spam	that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
ham	him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
spam	circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
spam	and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
ham	him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me."
spam	Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
spam	this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
spam	unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
ham	admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
spam	it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
ham	never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
spam	their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there
ham	is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
spam	rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
spam	respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
ham	mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
ham	Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
ham	better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.
ham	"There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird," said
spam	Miss Pross; "and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a
spam	mistake in life."
ham	Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had
spam	established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
spam	who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
spam	speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
spam	no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon
spam	(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
spam	matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
spam	"As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
spam	business," he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
ham	sat down there in friendly relations, "let me ask you--does the Doctor,
ham	in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?"
ham	"Never."
spam	"And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?"
ham	"Ah!" returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. "But I don't say he don't
ham	refer to it within himself."
spam	"Do you believe that he thinks of it much?"
spam	"I do," said Miss Pross.
ham	"Do you imagine--" Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
spam	short with:
spam	"Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all."
ham	"I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
spam	sometimes?"
ham	"Now and then," said Miss Pross.
ham	"Do you suppose," Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
ham	bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, "that Doctor Manette has any
spam	theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
ham	the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
ham	oppressor?"
ham	"I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me."
ham	"And that is--?"
spam	"That she thinks he has."
spam	"Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
spam	mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business."
spam	"Dull?" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
ham	Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, "No, no,
ham	no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
ham	Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
spam	he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
ham	though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
spam	intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
ham	attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss
ham	Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
ham	zealous interest."
spam	"Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell
spam	me," said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, "he is afraid
spam	of the whole subject."
spam	"Afraid?"
ham	"It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It's a dreadful
ham	remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
spam	knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
ham	feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make the
spam	subject pleasant, I should think."
ham	It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. "True," said
spam	he, "and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
spam	Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
ham	always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
spam	it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence."
spam	"Can't be helped," said Miss Pross, shaking her head. "Touch that
spam	string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
ham	In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in
ham	the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
ham	up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
ham	know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
ham	his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
spam	and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says
spam	a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
ham	best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
spam	together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
ham	brought him to himself."
spam	Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a
spam	perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
spam	in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
ham	her possessing such a thing.
ham	The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
spam	had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
spam	seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
spam	set it going.
spam	"Here they are!" said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
ham	"and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!"
ham	It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
spam	peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
spam	looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
spam	they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
spam	the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
spam	heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
spam	at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
spam	was ready at the street door to receive them.
spam	Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
ham	off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
spam	with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
spam	folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
spam	as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
spam	had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant
ham	sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
spam	her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
ham	playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
spam	chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
spam	them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
spam	eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
ham	have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
ham	beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
spam	stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
spam	Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
ham	for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.
ham	Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
spam	the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
ham	always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
ham	quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
ham	contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
ham	better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
spam	kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
ham	impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
spam	impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
ham	of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
spam	who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
spam	or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
ham	a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
spam	pleased.
ham	On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
ham	persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
spam	regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
ham	which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
spam	Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts
ham	to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.
spam	It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
ham	wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
ham	there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
ham	they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
spam	the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some
ham	time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
ham	plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs
spam	and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
spam	whispered to them in its own way above their heads.
ham	Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
ham	presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
ham	was only One.
spam	Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
spam	suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
spam	retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
spam	disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, "a fit of the
spam	jerks."
ham	The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The
ham	resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
spam	they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
ham	his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
ham	likeness.
spam	He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
spam	vivacity. "Pray, Doctor Manette," said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
ham	plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
ham	which happened to be the old buildings of London--"have you seen much of
spam	the Tower?"
ham	"Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
spam	it, to know that it teems with interest; little more."
spam	"_I_ have been there, as you remember," said Darnay, with a smile,
ham	though reddening a little angrily, "in another character, and not in a
ham	character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
spam	curious thing when I was there."
spam	"What was that?" Lucie asked.
ham	"In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
spam	had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
spam	its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
spam	prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
spam	in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
ham	execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with
spam	some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
ham	At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
spam	examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
spam	legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
ham	were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
spam	that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
spam	floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
ham	earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
ham	the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
ham	or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
ham	had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler."
spam	"My father," exclaimed Lucie, "you are ill!"
ham	He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and
ham	his look quite terrified them all.
spam	"No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
spam	made me start. We had better go in."
ham	He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
spam	drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he
ham	said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
spam	of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
ham	either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
spam	towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
spam	when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
ham	He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
spam	his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
spam	steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
spam	was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
ham	that the rain had startled him.
spam	Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
ham	her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
ham	made only Two.
ham	The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
spam	windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
spam	done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
ham	heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
spam	leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
spam	the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
ham	ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
ham	"The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few," said Doctor
spam	Manette. "It comes slowly."
spam	"It comes surely," said Carton.
spam	They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
ham	dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
ham	There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
ham	get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
spam	resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
spam	footstep was there.
ham	"A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!" said Darnay, when they had
spam	listened for a while.
ham	"Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?" asked Lucie. "Sometimes, I have
spam	sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
spam	a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
spam	solemn--"
ham	"Let us shudder too. We may know what it is."
ham	"It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
ham	originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
ham	sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
ham	the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
ham	by-and-bye into our lives."
spam	"There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,"
spam	Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.
ham	The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
ham	rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
spam	as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
spam	coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
spam	the distant streets, and not one within sight.
spam	"Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
spam	are we to divide them among us?"
spam	"I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
spam	asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
spam	then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
ham	into my life, and my father's."
ham	"I take them into mine!" said Carton. "_I_ ask no questions and make no
spam	stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
spam	and I see them--by the Lightning." He added the last words, after there
ham	had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.
ham	"And I hear them!" he added again, after a peal of thunder. "Here they
ham	come, fast, fierce, and furious!"
ham	It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
ham	for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
ham	lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's
spam	interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
spam	midnight.
ham	The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when
ham	Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
ham	forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
spam	of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
ham	of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
spam	usually performed a good two hours earlier.
ham	"What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry," said Mr. Lorry, "to
spam	bring the dead out of their graves."
spam	"I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what
spam	would do that," answered Jerry.
spam	"Good night, Mr. Carton," said the man of business. "Good night, Mr.
ham	Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!"
spam	Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
ham	bearing down upon them, too.
spam	VII. Monseigneur in Town
ham	Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
ham	fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
ham	his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
ham	the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
ham	was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
ham	things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
ham	rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so
spam	much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
ham	strong men besides the Cook.
ham	Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
spam	Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
spam	pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
spam	conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One lacquey carried
spam	the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
ham	the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
spam	a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
ham	watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
spam	dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
ham	place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
ham	his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
spam	men; he must have died of two.
spam	Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
ham	and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
spam	a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
spam	impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
spam	more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
ham	state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
spam	for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
ham	favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
spam	days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
ham	Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
ham	was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
spam	business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
spam	his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and
spam	particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
spam	was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original
spam	by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: "The earth and the fulness
spam	thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur."
ham	Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
ham	his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
ham	affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
spam	public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
ham	must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
spam	private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
spam	generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
spam	Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
ham	time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
spam	wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
ham	poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
spam	a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
ham	rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
ham	mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
ham	down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
spam	A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his
spam	stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
spam	waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
spam	forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
ham	relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
ham	among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.
ham	For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
spam	every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
spam	achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
ham	reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
ham	so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
spam	equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
ham	have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
ham	been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
spam	destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
spam	civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
spam	worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
spam	all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
ham	pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
ham	Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
ham	anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
ham	score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
spam	yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
spam	passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
ham	no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
ham	for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
spam	patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
ham	discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
spam	State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
spam	root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
ham	they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
ham	Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
spam	card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
ham	Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
spam	wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
spam	the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
ham	since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
ham	subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
spam	exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
ham	notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
spam	among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
spam	of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
spam	the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
ham	appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
spam	bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
spam	towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
ham	known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
spam	and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
ham	supped as at twenty.
ham	The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
spam	upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
ham	people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
spam	things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
ham	them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
ham	sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
spam	whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
spam	spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
spam	Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
ham	three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
ham	jargon about "the Centre of Truth:" holding that Man had got out of the
ham	Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
spam	out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
ham	the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
ham	by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
ham	discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
ham	became manifest.
spam	But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
spam	Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
spam	ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
spam	correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
ham	delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
ham	swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
spam	surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
ham	of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
ham	languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
ham	and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
ham	fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
spam	his devouring hunger far away.
ham	Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
spam	things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
spam	was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
ham	Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
ham	of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
spam	descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
ham	required to officiate "frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
ham	and white silk stockings." At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
spam	rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
ham	Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
ham	him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
spam	Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
ham	of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
ham	hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
spam	see the very stars out!
ham	Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
spam	chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
ham	open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
spam	fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
ham	body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
spam	been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
spam	troubled it.
ham	Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
ham	happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
spam	passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
ham	Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
spam	course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
spam	sprites, and was seen no more.
spam	The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
ham	and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
ham	but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
spam	and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
ham	way out.
ham	"I devote you," said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
ham	and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, "to the Devil!"
spam	With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
ham	dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
spam	He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
spam	with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
spam	feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
ham	beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
spam	of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
ham	change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
ham	colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
spam	by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
spam	treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
ham	attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
ham	line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
ham	too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
ham	handsome face, and a remarkable one.
ham	Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
ham	drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
ham	stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
ham	in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
ham	to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
spam	often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were
spam	charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
spam	check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
ham	sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
spam	that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
ham	custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
spam	barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
spam	time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
spam	left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
ham	With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
ham	consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
spam	dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
spam	before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
ham	its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
ham	wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
ham	number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
ham	But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
spam	stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
spam	behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
ham	and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.
ham	"What has gone wrong?" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.
spam	A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
ham	the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
spam	down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
ham	"Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!" said a ragged and submissive man, "it is
ham	a child."
ham	"Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?"
spam	"Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes."
ham	The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
ham	into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
ham	got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
ham	Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.
spam	"Killed!" shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
spam	their length above his head, and staring at him. "Dead!"
spam	The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
ham	nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
ham	and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
ham	people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
spam	remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
spam	and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
spam	over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.
ham	He took out his purse.
ham	"It is extraordinary to me," said he, "that you people cannot take care
spam	of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
spam	the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
ham	him that."
ham	He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
ham	craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
ham	tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, "Dead!"
ham	He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
ham	made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
ham	sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
spam	stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
spam	were as silent, however, as the men.
spam	"I know all, I know all," said the last comer. "Be a brave man, my
spam	Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
ham	live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
ham	as happily?"
spam	"You are a philosopher, you there," said the Marquis, smiling. "How do
spam	they call you?"
spam	"They call me Defarge."
ham	"Of what trade?"
ham	"Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine."
ham	"Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine," said the Marquis,
spam	throwing him another gold coin, "and spend it as you will. The horses
spam	there; are they right?"
spam	Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
ham	Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
spam	air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
ham	paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
ham	disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.
spam	"Hold!" said Monsieur the Marquis. "Hold the horses! Who threw that?"
spam	He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
ham	moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
spam	the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
spam	figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
ham	"You dogs!" said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
spam	except as to the spots on his nose: "I would ride over any of you very
ham	willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
spam	threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
ham	should be crushed under the wheels."
spam	So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
ham	what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
spam	a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
ham	But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
ham	Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
ham	contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
spam	leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word "Go on!"
ham	He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
spam	succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
spam	Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
spam	whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
ham	had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
spam	on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spam	spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
ham	which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
ham	bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
spam	while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
ham	of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
ham	had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
ham	of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
ham	into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
spam	time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
spam	in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
spam	things ran their course.
spam	VIII. Monseigneur in the Country
ham	A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
spam	Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
spam	and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
ham	inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
spam	tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
spam	disposition to give up, and wither away.
spam	Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
ham	lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
ham	a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
ham	no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
ham	occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
ham	sun.
spam	The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
ham	gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. "It will
spam	die out," said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, "directly."
ham	In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
ham	heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
ham	hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
spam	quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
spam	left when the drag was taken off.
spam	But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
spam	at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
spam	church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
spam	fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
ham	as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
ham	coming near home.
spam	The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
ham	tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
spam	fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
ham	its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
ham	shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
spam	fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
spam	the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
spam	were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
ham	for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
spam	paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
spam	the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
ham	Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
spam	their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
ham	terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
spam	or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
spam	Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions'
spam	whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
ham	if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
spam	his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
spam	fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
ham	He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
spam	sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
ham	meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
spam	truth through the best part of a hundred years.
spam	Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
spam	drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
spam	Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
spam	drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
ham	of the roads joined the group.
spam	"Bring me hither that fellow!" said the Marquis to the courier.
spam	The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
ham	to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
ham	"I passed you on the road?"
spam	"Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road."
ham	"Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?"
spam	"Monseigneur, it is true."
ham	"What did you look at, so fixedly?"
ham	"Monseigneur, I looked at the man."
spam	He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
ham	carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
spam	"What man, pig? And why look there?"
spam	"Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag."
spam	"Who?" demanded the traveller.
spam	"Monseigneur, the man."
ham	"May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
spam	know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?"
ham	"Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of
spam	all the days of my life, I never saw him."
ham	"Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?"
ham	"With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
ham	His head hanging over--like this!"
ham	He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
spam	face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
ham	himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
spam	"What was he like?"
ham	"Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
ham	white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!"
spam	The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
ham	eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
spam	the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
ham	conscience.
spam	"Truly, you did well," said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
spam	vermin were not to ruffle him, "to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
ham	and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
ham	Gabelle!"
spam	Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
ham	united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
spam	examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
ham	official manner.
spam	"Bah! Go aside!" said Monsieur Gabelle.
spam	"Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
ham	to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle."
ham	"Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders."
ham	"Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?"
spam	The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
spam	particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some
ham	half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
spam	presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
spam	"Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?"
ham	"Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
ham	a person plunges into the river."
ham	"See to it, Gabelle. Go on!"
spam	The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
spam	wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
spam	to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
ham	they might not have been so fortunate.
ham	The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
spam	rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
ham	it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
spam	sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
ham	gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
spam	points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
ham	courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.
spam	At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
ham	with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
ham	figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
ham	studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
ham	dreadfully spare and thin.
spam	To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
spam	growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
spam	turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
spam	presented herself at the carriage-door.
ham	"It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition."
ham	With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
spam	Monseigneur looked out.
ham	"How, then! What is it? Always petitions!"
spam	"Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester."
ham	"What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He
spam	cannot pay something?"
